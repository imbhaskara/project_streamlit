# Among Us EDA Web Application using Streamlit
Hello Everyone! Do you know the Among Us Game? This phenomenal game is growing fast in Google Play and App Store Platform. Some Colleagues and I who have graduated from <a href="https://iykra.com/datamba/">IYKRA Data MBA</a> Batch IV, tried to scrap, analyze, and visualize comment sections of this games (see our previous projects at the end of the post). In this ocassion, we will wrap our previous projects result into a web application, and deploy it so that it is more easier to be accessed.
<br><br>
In case you missed it, in our previous projects, we tried to do a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) from the Google Play Store User Ratings and Comments for Among Us Game. The scrapping process have already been done before with the data range of September 22nd to October 20th and saved in Microsoft Excel format.
